<h3> HOW THE GAME WORKS </H3> 

The aim of the game is to collect more balls than your opponent before the time runs out.

<h3> CHALLANGES </H3> 

The main challenge I encountered during the creation f this game was making sure the cubes could connect the dots. Each dot has a different set of outcomes for a connection and it also had to effect the correct player's score. I overcame this by initially writing out all the outcomes in the code and commenting on each section, I later refactored my code to make it shorter. 

<h3> IMPROVEMENTS </h3>

I would like to make the game more responsive, mainly the start screen. I was also like to add more sliders so players have the choice of changing a number of balls. I would like to work on the connection of the cubes and dots a bit more and something is wont pick up the connecting fast enough. I would like to make the game quicker as at the moment it is a little laggy at times. I would also like to add more levels with maybe a maze-like style and moving balls.
